cd event-bookings-automation
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
npx playwright install
```
3. Install Playwright browsers

```

##  Running the Tests

1. Run tests in headed mode (with browser UI):
```bash
npx playwright test tests/auth.spec.js --headed --timeout=300000
```
2. Run tests in headless mode (faster, without UI):
```bash
npx playwright test tests/auth.spec.js --timeout=300000
```
3. Run tests with trace debugging:   
```bash
npx playwright test tests/auth.spec.js --headed --timeout=300000 --trace on
```
4. View test report:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
## Test Results

The test generates:

- Screenshots on failure (in ```test-results/``` directory)
- Video recordings of test runs
- Trace files for debugging
- HTML reports with detailed test results
